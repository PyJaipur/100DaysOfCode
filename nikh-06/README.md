# Nikhil Jain

I am a First Year IT student at Manipal University Jaipur.I am currently learning Python from Udemy. By the end of these 100 days I will try to complete my ongoing Python Course and a project in Django(A Blog Application) as well as in Tkinter

### Day 1 

Today I started my day by making a Rock Paper Scissor game then I moved forward in my Python Course learning List and List Comprehensions and practised it and I also started Hackerank and solved some easy problems on it.

### Day 2

Today I learned basics of Dictionary and some methods related to it and I continued solving problems on HackerRank as well as started solving problems on Leetcode also.

### Day 3

Today I started Harvard CS50 in which I learned basics of C then I solved problems on HackerRank.

### Day 4 

Today I learned Basics of Dictionary in Python and solved Problem Set 1 of Harvard CS50.

### Day 5

Today I moved forward in my Python Course and learned more about Dictionary and methods related to it.

### Day 6 

Today I solved many problems related to Dictionary in Python. Started 2nd Lecture of Harvard CS50. I realise I enjoy coding in C more because it just seems like I am giving instruction to Computer Directly whereas in Python It seems like I am talking to just another person.Though I am very newbie to make any comparison between Python and C (But still just a thought).

### Day 7

Today I created a data model of a spotify playlist. Made a program which save playlist for different user allowing them to update their paylist and I am thinking to update this program further more.Then I solved some problems on HackerRank.

### Day 8 and 9

In these two days I completed quite a few problems on HackerRank.Now I feel quite confident with Dictonaries and List Data Structures in Python.Now in coming days I will look forward to continue my Python Course will try to complete it as soon as possible.

### Day 10 

Today was a hectic day came back from college at 5pm .Then I decided to take break from my regular python course and learn Web Scrapping from "Automate The Boring Stuff".I completed the lesson and created a Python Script to fetch me live cricket score from Crickbuzz website.Though I also wanted to make a notification pop up to appear on my desktop using notify2 module.I was not succesfull in doing it will try it any other day though.
