# Nikhil Jain

I am a First Year IT student at Manipal University Jaipur.I am currently learning Python from Udemy. By the end of these 100 days I will try to complete my ongoing Python Course and a project in Django(A Blog Application) as well as in Tkinter

### Day 1 

Today I started my day by making a Rock Paper Scissor game then I moved forward in my Python Course learning List and List Comprehensions and practised it and I also started Hackerank and solved some easy problems on it.

### Day 2

Today I learned basics of Dictionary and some methods related to it and I continued solving problems on HackerRank as well as started solving problems on Leetcode also.

### Day 3

Today I started Harvard CS50 in which I learned basics of C then I solved problems on HackerRank.

### Day 4 

Today I learned Basics of Dictionary in Python and solved Problem Set 1 of Harvard CS50.

### Day 5

Today I moved forward in my Python Course and learned more about Dictionary and methods related to it.

### Day 6 

Today I solved many problems related to Dictionary in Python. Started 2nd Lecture of Harvard CS50. I realise I enjoy coding in C more because it just seems like I am giving instruction to Computer Directly whereas in Python It seems like I am talking to just another person.Though I am very newbie to make any comparison between Python and C (But still just a thought).

### Day 7

Today I created a data model of a spotify playlist. Made a program which save playlist for different user allowing them to update their paylist and I am thinking to update this program further more.Then I solved some problems on HackerRank.

### Day 8 and 9

In these two days I completed quite a few problems on HackerRank.Now I feel quite confident with Dictonaries and List Data Structures in Python.Now in coming days I will look forward to continue my Python Course will try to complete it as soon as possible.

### Day 10 

Today was a hectic day came back from college at 5pm .Then I decided to take break from my regular python course and learn Web Scrapping from "Automate The Boring Stuff".I completed the lesson and created a Python Script to fetch me live cricket score from Crickbuzz website.Though I also wanted to make a notification pop up to appear on my desktop using notify2 module.I was not succesfull in doing it will try it any other day though. 

### Day 11

Today I moved forward in my Python Course and learnt Tuple and Sets and started functions basic and learnt Function Calls and Stack got to know about Call Frame and Run Time Stack. 
 
### Day 12,13 and 14
