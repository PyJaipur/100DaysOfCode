# Piyush Agarwal
on the beginnning of this new year i take the oath to complete this challenge and currently i am a 2nd year cse student finished with 3rd sem and i am learning python through courses over coursera.
i have knowledge for python basics, data structure, web accessing with python, in progress to learn working over sql using python.
i am workaholic able to move forward when i have a goal.

### Day 1
it was a great day in regards more to learning less to actual coding.
i learned abour open source software , actually finished up my learning course over coursera by which i learned about various licenses available and how one is supposed to work in an OSS project.
further in python , i studied about working with base. due i only finished with understanding the basic structure of it and difference between a DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR and SOFTWARE DEVELOPER and bit of exposure to use of sqllite.
i have decided to continue my work on sqllite from tomorrow.
in terms of code, created a simple code to find if certain array contains similar elements (contains_duplicate.py).

### Day 2
not much just studied some basic query language that can be used over sqllite.
creating tables, adding or deleting data or updating it.

### Day 3
working over web scrapping program, still unable to resolve the issues.
trying to scrap data from a webpage.

### Day 4
couldn't get time today for coding but still tried to learn and understand the concept of database design and modelling felt somewhat similar to dfd.
