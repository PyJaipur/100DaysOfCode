# Who am I?
Halo! I am Tanay Mehta, a freshman studying in JECRC University. I have a strong passion for Deep Learning, Statistical Modelling, Reinforcement Learning and Computational Neuroscience. I am also 'good-enough' at MEAN Stack, Little-bit of Back-end Web Development and some Basic Web Development here and there. My plans for upcoming 100 days is to work slowly but surely on a Mathematics and Statistical Modelling Library that I am going to build in Python from scratch (P.S: My interpretation of Scratch means NO EXTERNAL LIBRARY, not even numpy).
So, let's hope, we can finish our projects before 100 Days End!
Happy Hacking!

### Day 1

+Added
1. "matrix-generation-and-operations.py"
Here, I have defined 1D and 2D Matrix generation (both zero-matrix and random-matrix).
Also, I have added a class of operators called "MatrixOps" which currently has only one function, 'transpose(array)'; which as the name suggests, transposes the matrix passed as a parameter. Preferably a matrix generated from the above functions for Matrix Generation.

/\Plans: To add Tensor generation and Tensors of more than 3 ranks (preferable upto 8 dimensions would work, unless you are a high-energy physicist at fermilab!(pun there.))

### Day 2
+Added
1. A Linear regression model in Python (Numpy) is added. It does multivariate Linear Regression on Boston House Pricing Dataset. It is still under work, but most of it works just fine. It is implemented in Python by only using Two External Libraries, i.e; Numpy and Pandas.

/\Plans: To make it more memory efficient and decrease it's time complexity.

### Day 3
+Added
1. On Day 02, I added Linear Regression in Plain old Numpy, that was great for skills and all but it lacked good accuracy and memory efficiency. That's Why I have made another Linear Regression Model but now in Core Tensorflow (NO HIGH LEVEL API, I hate these Keras, sklearn and tf.estimator api's).

/\Plans: Tomorrow I will add a simple data Visualisation model in Javascript made in D3.js

### Day 4
+Added
1. Today I made the front-end of a Web-app (under serious development), this web app will have it's backend made upon NodeJS (S.O.L.I.D Principles). So far only the Front-end is done and dusted, although, there are lots of changes coming to it.
/\Plans: Best development happens when you do things the unplanned way!

### Day 5
+Added
1. Today I learned and implemented Ray Tracing Algorithm in Python 3.5 using Numpy as Matplotlib. This Algorithm Imlpements the State-of-the are ray tracing algorithm and uses it render an image and save it too.

/\Plans: Tommorow I will Implement Logistic Regression in Python using Only Numpy (and sckit-learn for Data Loading). This will be done on Iris Dataset. 

### Day 6
+Added
1. Today, I performed Logistic Regression in Python (Numpy) without using any external functions (like LinearRegressor in Keras, etc). This can serve as an assignment implmentation of Andrew NG's Machine Learning course's (on Coursera) 3rd/4rth Week. It only uses Scikit-learn for importing training data. This is done on Iris Dataset.

/\Plans: Honestly! I don't know!!
