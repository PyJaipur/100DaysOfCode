# Who am I?
Halo! I am Tanay Mehta, a freshman studying in JECRC University. I have a strong passion for Deep Learning, Statistical Modelling, Reinforcement Learning and Computational Neuroscience. I am also 'good-enough' at MEAN Stack, Little-bit of Back-end Web Development and some Basic Web Development here and there. My plans for upcoming 100 days is to work slowly but surely on a Mathematics and Statistical Modelling Library that I am going to build in Python from scratch (P.S: My interpretation of Scratch means NO EXTERNAL LIBRARY, not even numpy).
So, let's hope we all can reach our goals before 100 Days End!
Happy Hacking!

### Day 1

+Added
1. "matrix-generation-and-operations.py"
Here, I have defined 1D and 2D Matrix generation (both zero-matrix and random-matrix).
Also, I have added a class of operators called "MatrixOps" which currently has only one function, 'transpose(array)'; which as the name suggests, transposes the matrix passed as a parameter. Preferably a matrix generated from the above functions for Matrix Generation.

/\Plans: To add Tensor generation and Tensors of more than 3 ranks (preferable upto 8 dimensions would work, unless you are a high-energy physicist at fermilab!(pun there.))

### Day 2


### Day 3


### Day 4


### Day 5
