I'm a 1st year B.Tech CSE student. 
I like everything with a bit of Python sprinkled on it. 



### Day 1 - 

Started a new Django project, this time to make a project that I hope I'll be proud of. Established the urls and configured the files accordingly, will continue on this project. Following Cody Schafer's Tutorials on YouTube.

Completed some more challenges at picoCTF. Have been learning the basics of reverse engineering and getting comfortable with the linux terminal.


### day 2 - 

Trained models on the iris data set using sklearn. 
understood how Knn works.
understood how logisticregression (which is a classifier despite its name) works.
Following the data school youtube channel.



### day 3 - 

Continued with the data school series. 
studied how to evaluate and measure what models best fit the job.
used the metrics accuracy score to evaluate. 
using this method had its flaws- comparing the predicitions and testing it against the same dataset will always give high accuracy; unreliable for out of sample data.

Used the train/test split procedure to rectify this.
it splits the dataset into a training set and testing set.
the model trains on the training set and tests itself against the testing set.
this gives a good idea as to how itll perform with out of sample data.

was able to find the best value for n in Knn by plotting different values and accuracy on a graph using pyplot.
learning about what high/low variance and bias mean.

### day 4 - 

continued with the data school tutorials.

used pandas and seaborn on a new dataset to first import a csv. used methods and functions from pandas to modify the csv according to my requirements.

using seaborn i was able to plot the best fit line across the scatterplot formed. (the dataset imported had a continuous variable, thus used regression)

I now have some idea on how data is studied and manipulated to make analysis easier.
