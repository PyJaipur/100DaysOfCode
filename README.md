# 100 Days Of Code

Welcome to **100 Days of Code** and congratulations on accepting this challenge. This challenge is bought to you by [**PyJaipur**](https://t.me/PyJaipur) along with [**AndroidDev Jaipur**](https://t.me/AndroidDevJaipur). Be sure to join those groups to stay updated on the challenge and more!

## Getting Started
To get started, fork this repository, then on your fork, create a new directory called **[MyName]** (replace `[MyName]' with your actual name). Copy the contents of [Template.md](Template.md) in a 'Readme.md' file inside your new directory and replace the template text with your own. Do also include your telegram username in the description. Then, make a pull request in the original repository with the title as your name. Keep updating the repository daily with your updates!

### Important Notes:
* If your pull request has not been merged and you want to make a change, do **not** open a new pull request. Instead, keep making the changes on your fork and the open pull reuest will automatically include those changes.
* Only make a new pull request if your original one has been merged. Be reasonable with the frequency of your pull requests. Keep in mind there are many others who have also made a pull request and allow the moderators reasonable time to review your work.

## Share your updates
