Hi, I am a sophomore pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at The LNMIIT, Jaipur. 

I currently work in: 

* Full Stack Web Development
* HTML,CSS,Javascript and Bootstrap for FrontEnd
* Node.js in Backend
* C++14 for competitive programming

My Aim for the next 100 Days would be:

* I intend to strengthen my knowledge of the languages I already am familiar with by building some good projects.

* I would like to complete my full stack course including React and ReactNative and also a course based on algorithms.

* I would also like to strengthen my competitive coding skills by practicing daily.
