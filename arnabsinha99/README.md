Hi, I am a sophomore pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at The LNMIIT, Jaipur.

I currently work in the following languages:

* Python for Data Science , ML and AI
* HTML and CSS for frontend
* C++14 for competitive programming

I have slight experience in Bootstrap 4 framework also.

These would be my aim for the next 100 days:-

* I intend to strengthen my grasp over the languages I already am familiar with and also look forward to learn JavaScript, JQuery, Django Framework and Tensorflow Framework.

* I would also like to work further in Python for Data Science purposes and have major progress in the construction of my own website.

I learnt the Bootstrap and JavaScript part of the following course: Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp

These were the following things I learnt and practised it hands on:-

* Grids in Bootstrap 4

* alert() statement, console.log() statement and prompt() statement

* Connecting JS file to HTML file using "script" statement

* Operators, Control flow, while loops, for loops, functions, arrays and objects in JS followed by practising various codes in it.

I also solved problem 1095A on Codeforces. Solution is [here](https://ideone.com/qFVv2l)
