Hi, I am a sophomore pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at The LNMIIT, Jaipur. 

I currently work in the following languages: 

* Python for Data Science , ML and AI
* HTML and CSS for backend
* C++14 for competitive programming

I have slight experience in Bootstrap 4 framework also. 

These would be my aim for the next 100 days:-

* I intend to strengthen my grasp over the languages I already am familiar with and also look forward to learn JavaScript, JQuery, Django Framework and Tensorflow Framework.

* I would also like to work further in Python for Data Science purposes and have major progress in the construction of my own website.


### Day 1

I learnt the Bootstrap and JavaScript part of the following course: Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp

These were the following things I learnt and practised it hands on:-

* Grids in Bootstrap 4

* alert() statement, console.log() statement and prompt() statement

* Connecting JS file to HTML file using "script" statement 

* Operators, Control flow, while loops, for loops, functions, arrays and objects in JS followed by practising various codes in it.

I also solved problem 1095A on Codeforces. Solution is [here](https://ideone.com/qFVv2l)

I also added contributed to my project whose link is [here](https://github.com/arnabsinha99/Site-honn-te) . This is my personal website which I am to build. 


### Day 2

* I learnt the meaning of Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript today. I also learnt how to use functions such as addEventListener() and others to interact with the website. I used this to generate random colors on the header of my website that I am building.

* Following is the query I had posted today on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54003762/getelementbyid-function-is-returning-null-for-existing-header-id/54003818?noredirect=1#comment94850062_54003818)

* I learnt the basics of JQuery which includes the use  of $ sign. 

* I solved the problem [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/) and my submission is available [here](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/198499974/)


### Day 3

* Progressed on my website. 

* Solved [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) and [here](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/198743978/)

### Day 4

* Implemented SVM on Jupyter Notebook

* Learnt the various functions like classification_report() , confusion_matrix() in sklearn 

* Tried to solve the first problem of CodeChef January Long Challenge


### Day 5

* Implemented SVM in a different way, using GridSearchCV, in Jupyter Notebook.

* Solved the first problem of CodeChef Lomg Challenge successfully. 

### Day 6

* I solved the second question of Codeforces long challenge and also looked up the concepts and code of NLP in Machine Learning.
