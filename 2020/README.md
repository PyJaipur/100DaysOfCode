# 100DaysOfCode with PyJaipur

100 Days of Code is a self improvement tool, where you make a commitment to solve 1 coding problem everyday for the next 100 days.

## Rules

- Solve 1 problem every day
- Commit solutions to this repo. Use `<year>/<name>/<filename>`.
    - The recommended format is to have `d1.py` etc as a filename.
    - Your own name is recommended to be in lowercase. Please don't use profanity; it's childish.
- Each code file should contain a link to the problem you solved as the first comment.
- There is no language restriction. Try to solve the problem in any language you want.


## Benefits

* Coding will become a daily habit for you.
* Every day that you consistently code, you’ll build momentum. That momentum will make it easier for you to learn more advanced topics.
* Your GitHub profile will look extremely active. And yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these.
* You’ll greatly diminish your fear of starting a new coding project. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.
* You’ll have a good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day.
