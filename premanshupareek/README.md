# Introduction

My name is Premanshu Pareek. I am Computer Science and Engineering graduate from the 2018 batch. I have a keen interest in AI and ML and I am always working on improving my skills in this area. The thought of the impact that AI can have in the future really inspires me. On the other hand, I am also a web developer and continuously working on getting better at it. I have also written some blogs for OpenSense Lab about Drupal and relevant technologies that you can read about [here](https://opensenselabs.com/user/premanshu).
