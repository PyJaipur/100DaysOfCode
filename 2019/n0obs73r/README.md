# Aryan Dadheech
Hoi, I'm Aryan Dadheech. Currently pursuing Btech from JECRC University,Jaipur.

I've done some projects on IOT. I was into AI and Machine learning but after knowing the requirements just to get started with it were a nightmare for me. So for now, I've backed-up and been searching and scratching the surfaces different fields just to get the taste of everything. Yeah, I'm an explorer too :v . You can call me a noob, Well that's what my username say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but i do have a passion for learning new stuff.

As a fresher i don't have a working experience, but i do have the will to learn. 
In this upcoming time, taking #100DaysofCode as a challenge i'd be learning about android develpoment and language C++. And I've rolled into a Machine learning course as well just to have an idea about how things work around in advance alogs :')

# Happy Coding 

### Day 1
Today I learned about overall model process of supervised and unsupervised learning
later following to linear regression and some examples. Also I've been tracking progress
of my friend @DeadVampire aka Alucard about Binary trees and linked lists :3 .

> Also on the android development side :-

- [x] Started with kotlin.
- [x] Understanding the basic layout of App.
- [x] Creating Resources with strings.
- [x] More about constraints.
- [ ] Made an interactive App.

### Day 2

> In Machine Learning :-
- Progress in Model Representation and Cost Function - Intuition.
- Interacting with GNU octave interpreter.
- Came across a few problems of systems of equations with linear algebra operations on vectors and matrices.(Although i didn't solved any, I was just understanding the way of solving them).

> Android Development :-

- Getting started with flutter as it was pretty user friendly and is now treanding for app development.  

### Day 3
