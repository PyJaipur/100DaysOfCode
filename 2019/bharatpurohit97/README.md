- ### University - Centre For Converging Technologies, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur

- ### Dual Degree B.Tech + M.Tech - Pre-Final Year  

# Day 1
 I am working on a project in Bioinformatics, Some kind of simualation for DNA.
 
 today i implemented multiprocessing for [Biosensor-Python](https://github.com/DBT-BIF/Biosensor-Python) class. 
 
 The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a machine.
 
 i will make it online after running programme locally to all `Genomes` (approx) ~18,00,000. i will be more happy if anyone wants to learn more about project.


# Day 2
Today i worked on android app using React-native Framework.
- setup local enviroment
- created Login and Signup in js and route for Navigation
- [committed](https://github.com/bharatpurohit97/LetsMatch/commit/64eb416fa2f8cd119f118f2ec8c8183b5214bee6) on Github.
