# Ravi Kumawat
I have no special talent, I'm just passionately curious. I believe in this. I basically stepped into this field when I used to compile custom forks of AOSP but gradually, curiosity got the better of me and I dived right into C/C++.C++ will always be my preferred language and the one I am most comfortable to work with but no surprise I'm here right now because in this field, you can't limit yourself to your comfort zone and personal preferences, you gotta explore new things and move forward. And so I started learning python, mainly for Data Science and AI applications, and it's going great as of now.
 
I'm a 1st year B.Tech CSE student. I'm currently following Andrew Ng's ML course on coursera and improving my grasp on Data Structures and Algorithms.

As my new year's resolution, I commit to take **#100DaysOfCode** challenge as a serious check in for doing something productive everyday even if it's for at least an hour, and keep strong dedication towards it.

## Happy Coding!

### Day 1
Solved problems related to Binary Trees and Linked Lists on leetcode.
Can be checked out [here](https://leetcode.com/ravi4kumawat).

Gradually progressing in ML course and Django docs. Learnt about Uni and Multi-variate linear regression and gradient descent.

### Day 2
The same as usual daily routine of Problem Solving on leetcode and hackerrank.

Progress in ML - Octave/Matlab setup and basics, Intro to R and polynomial regression.

Django and backend basics.

### Day 3
Learnt and solved more about data structures and algorithms.

Examined and tried replicating standard libraries/modules on various functions and structures.

Progress in ML - Feature scaling, Learning Rate, polynomial regression basics.

### Day 4
Progress in ML - MATLAB/OCTAVE programming, R, solved some examples on multi variate linear regression.

Will push all my work since day 1 someday later as Internet connection is not stable here.

### Day 5
Progress in ML - Polynomial regression practice examples, logistic regression.

Solved some more problems on leetcode on data structures and oop.

### Day 6
Progress in ML - None, didn't get much time today

Solved some more problems on leetcode (mainly binary trees) and hackerrank, gradually attempting more difficult problems.

### Day 7
Progress in ML - Reimplemented Andrew Ng's linear regression exercise in Python and R.

*Let's Start Django* from today.

### Day 8
Progress in ML - Logistic regression examples and exercise.
Django - Queries and Database Layer.
Same daily routine of problem solving on leetcode and hackerrank.

### Day 9
Progress in ML - More on Logistic regression, implementing from scratch.

Django - Queries and forms.

And some time spent on leetcode.

### Day 10
Progrss In ML - Normal equation and more on Logistic Regression.

Django - Forms and web scraping.

### Day 11
Progress in ML - Classification and hypothesis representation.

Django - Views and URLs.

Solved and implemented some more questions from leetcode and hackerrank.

### Day 12
Progress in ML - Hypothesis, Decision boundary and optimizing the cost 
function.

Today was a tiring day, so nothing much else.

### Day 13
Progress in ML - Learnt more about binary classification, decision boundaries.

### Day 14
Progress in ML - Implemented Logistic regression and binary classification in python.

### Day 15
Progress in ML - Optimization and multi class classification.

### Day 16
Progress in ML - Advance Optimization, vectorization implemented with numpy and scikit learn.

### Day 17
Progress in ML - Regularized regression and some basic intro to TensorFlow.

### Day 18
Progress in ML - Neural networks with TensorFlow, multi class classification.

### Day 19
Progress in ML - Neural Networks and propagation, non linear hypothesis.

### Day 20
Progress in ML - Still working on multi class classification and neural networks.

### Day 21
Progress in ML - Digging deeper into TensorFlow and implementing some of its functions manually to have a better understanding.

### Day 22
Progress in ML - Overfitting, regularization, neural networks and model representation and some hands on with pytorch!

Getting familiar with advance concepts in C/C++ - Memory management, low level hardware programming (drivers for basic io devices).

Yeah, I know took I took a long break due to some unavoidable work(mostly including me being a sloth)! :v
I will try to be as much regular as possible from now on.

### Day 23
ML Progress - Neural networks, backpropagation algos and its implementation.

### Day 24
ML Progress - Model selection, testing and validation.

### Day 25
ML Progress - Bias and variance, learning methods and curves and 
some more in-depth in PyTorch.

### Day 26
ML Progress - Training a neural net and error analysis.

### Day 27
ML Progress - SVM, margin classification.

### Day 28
ML Progress - Using SVM, implementing in python from basic and using 
it from pyTorch.

### Day 29
ML Progress - Learned about SVR and SVM and implemented Random Forest Classification algo on a tourism spots dataset.

### Day 30
ML Progress - Hierarchical clustering, XGBoost and Upper confidence bound.

### Day 31
ML Progress - Analysis(Component and Discriminant), Kernel PCA and 
Sampling.
