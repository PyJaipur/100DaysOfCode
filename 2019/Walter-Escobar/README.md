# Karan Mannan

I'm a 1st year B.Tech CSE student. 
I like everything with a bit of Python sprinkled on it. 



### Day 1 - 

Started a new Django project, this time to make a project that I hope I'll be proud of. Established the urls and configured the files accordingly, will continue on this project. Following Cody Schafer's Tutorials on YouTube.

Completed some more challenges at picoCTF. Have been learning the basics of reverse engineering and getting comfortable with the linux terminal.


### day 2 - 

Trained models on the iris data set using sklearn. 
understood how Knn works.
understood how logisticregression (which is a classifier despite its name) works.
Following the data school youtube channel.



### day 3 - 

Continued with the data school series. 
studied how to evaluate and measure what models best fit the job.
used the metrics accuracy score to evaluate. 
using this method had its flaws- comparing the predicitions and testing it against the same dataset will always give high accuracy; unreliable for out of sample data.

Used the train/test split procedure to rectify this.
it splits the dataset into a training set and testing set.
the model trains on the training set and tests itself against the testing set.
this gives a good idea as to how itll perform with out of sample data.

was able to find the best value for n in Knn by plotting different values and accuracy on a graph using pyplot.
learning about what high/low variance and bias mean.

### day 4 - 

continued with the data school tutorials.

used pandas and seaborn on a new dataset to first import a csv. used methods and functions from pandas to modify the csv according to my requirements.

using seaborn i was able to plot the best fit line across the scatterplot formed. (the dataset imported had a continuous variable, thus used regression)

I now have some idea on how data is studied and manipulated to make analysis easier.
            
### day 5 - 

Contined with the data school tutorials.

learned how to use evaluation metrics to get more accurate results with regression problems. This time I imported LinearRegression from the sklearn library.
Starting to understand what the B1,2,3 coeffiecients mean in the regression formula. 
learned how to obtain those values for a particular problem.

used metrics from the sklearn library to evaluate predictions. learned the differences between MAE, MSE, RMSE and how to use them


### day 6 - 

trying to implement and use what i learned in the tutorials
downloaded the dataset for houseingprices available on kaggle.
have been trying to understand various ways and the practices used to tackle such a problem.
will be working on it for a few days .

### day 7 -

took a break from data science and switched to another kind of machine learning- open cv 
following sentedex's tutorials on open cv in python. 
learned how to load images , videos and do some basic operations on them.
also learned how to 'draw' on them (some basic shapes and polygons) 

Goal is object recognition. 
i hope ill reach there by day 17


### day 8 -

attended the angular workshop today.
learned how the framework works.
set up the basic requirements for it to work. 
will be following up with tutorials. 


### day 9 -

Continued with OpenCV- 

Learned what thresholding is. learned how to 'add' two images(freaky shit) .


learned how to filter out colours, though getting the right combination of colours is pretty hard.
used some common blurs to remove the noise, but its still not quite perfect


### day 10 - 

attended the hackathon today
tried building a solution for agricultural needs that aimed to help farmers find more storage units, in order to save crops from getting destroyed, and some other features.
used pyplot on a few csv's to map cost of cultivation and production of a few crops over the years in some states.
            
     
     
### day 11 - 
continued with open cv . learned how to detect edges.
experimented around with various methods around it.
started the cheat engine tutorial to get some insight on how to break programs.


### day 12 - 

got to step 8 of the cheat engine tutorial.
started a project on blender. I had some experience with blender but it has been a long time since ive laid my hands on it.



### day 13 -

Continued with openCV, learned how to filter out the background from an image using GrabCut.
grabcut is an algorithm that works out what should be the background and foreground in a given area of an image. 

cv had a module for it. used it to filter an orange from a pic of orange on a table top - https://imgur.com/gallery/ozv6tBv

will be continuing with blender later


### 14 - 

started a blender tutorial , set up the basic environment and learned the basic tools . 
watching blender tutorials


### 15 - 

will be making a doughnut and coffee scene in blender, watching the tutorials. 
the tools are a bit complicated but come with an intuitive sense when you get used to them
helped a friend with python problems


### 16 - 

still continuing with the blender tutorials . have become comfortable with blender now. Aim is to be able to create whatever scene and model i want to, and some basic animations / simulations

### 17 - 

continued with open cv and learned how to detect corners. used the GoodFeatureSelection function to detect corners. 
continuing with more tutorials.

Also made progress on the blender project. will be texturing and adding particles to the objects.
