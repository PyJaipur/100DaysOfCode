You need to prepare the study plan for the RTU semester examination as well as external practical exams, but there are certain constraints
which you need to follow in order to make your action plan.

Q.
You have total of 6 subjects, and each subject has 5 unit (comprising 10 chapters). Assignment of number of chapters is up to you.
Out of 6 subjects, you like 2 subjects and dislike 4 subjects. You cannot study the subjects you dislike more than 2 hours in a day
and there is no constraint on the hours of study of the subjects you like (max 6 hours).
Each chapter has 6 subtopics and you can read only 3 subtopics of the subject you like and 2 subtopics of the subject you dislike in an hour.
You can only give a study of maximum 6 hours a day.
Each subject is of 90 marks which is divided into 5 units.


Your RTU exams are approaching and there are only 23 days left to complete the course. You need to be really efficient in choosing the
units (basically with minimum no. of chapters) and complete the course as soon as possible.


1. You need to study in such a way that you can score maximum.
2. Print the study of each day in the format (subject_unit_chapter_subtopic).

Q.
Right after the RTU examination you have the practical exams.
There are 4 practical labs and each lab has total 12 practical. You will study for the 3 hours a day and can learn total of 4 practical.
You have 7 days to prepare for the practical exams.

//// Whats the optimisation question for this one sir, if I need to learn the practical then its constant ,i.e.
     in 1 day=>  3 hours= 4 practical
     in 7 days=> 3*7= 21 hours of study.
                 21 hours = 28 practical

                 1 subject= 12 practical
                 4 subject= 48 practical

Please pardon the question.
