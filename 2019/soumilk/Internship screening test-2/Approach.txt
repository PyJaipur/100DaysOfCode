Total time to prepare = 23 days
Total time to study in one day = 6 hours
1 day = 6 hours
23 days = 23*6 hours
23 days = 138 hours
So total time to prepare is 138 hours.

6 Subjects:
        like = 2
        dislike = 4
        could read 3 subtopics of like in one hour
        could read 2 subtopics of dislike in one hour
        Could not study 1 dislike subject for more than 2 hours a day

STUDY PLAN :

By following the optimization principal,
GREEDY APPROACH is used here:
We need to optimise the study plan so that student can score the maximum marks in the defined period of time

1. Determine the order in which we need to study each subject, i.e the unit which takes minimum time need to be studied first as
   each unit has equal marks.

2. Make a proper study plan in which we need to study the maximum units from each subject so as to score maximum in each subject.
3. Every subject contains 5 units and is equally important.

=> 4. We are reading each subject each day, i.e. 6 subjects in 6 hours each day.

Course coverage :
1 subject = 10 chapters
1 chapter = 6 subtopics
1 hour = 3 subtopics
2 hour = 6 subtopics = 1 chapter
1 chapter = 2 hours
10 chapter = 20 hours = 5 units
5 unit = 20 hours
1 subject = 5 units= 20 hours
2 subjects = 40 hours

DISLIKE :
Course coverage :
1 subject = 10 chapters
1 chapter = 6 subtopics
1 hour = 2 subtopics
3 hour = 6 subtopics = 1 chapter
1 chapter = 3 hours
10 chapter = 30 hours = 5 units
1 subject = 30 hours
4 subjects = 120 hours

So the net time required to complete the whole syllabus is 160 hours

MARKS DISTRIBUTION :
1 subject = 90 marks
1 subject = 5 units
1 unit = 90/15 = 18 marks
1 unit = 18 marks
