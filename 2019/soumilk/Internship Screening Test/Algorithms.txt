I have taken these factors into consideration:
1. There might be a case when both the Thanos and Bahubhali will attack at the same time.
2. The changes in the rules in each question is included in next question as well.
3. The damage percentage of a fighter's health is taken according to the health at that instant of time.

Made the code using the classes and objects.
Made use of functions.

LOGIC:

h_thanos : health of thanos
h_bahu   : health of Bahubhali
attack_no: total number of attacks
att_thanos_time: This is the time thanos require to fully recover for an attack
att_bahu_time : this is the time bahubali takes to fully recover from an attack

Ans-1 :
i. take the inputs from the user.
ii. check if the inputs are correct.
iii. generate a random value and do as per the rule.
iv. One of the fighters start the fight according to the generated random value and rule.
v. Run a while loop of time, till the health of any one of the fighter is 0.
  - When the time is equal to the time when the thanos is recovered then damage the health of Bahubhal
  - when the time is eual to the time when the bahubali is fully recovered then damage the health of thanos.
vi. one which is out of health is defeated.

Ans-2 :
i. take the inputs from the user.
ii. check if the inputs are correct.
iii. generate a random value and do as per the rule.
iv. One of the fighters start the fight according to the generated random value and rule.
v. Run a while loop of time, till the health of any one of the fighter is 0.
  - When the time is equal to the time when the thanos is recovered then:
      =check conditions  according to the rules given in the question and then damage the health of figher.
  - when the time is eual to the time when the bahubali is fully recovered then damage the health of thanos.
      =check conditions  according to the rules given in the question and then damage the health of figher.
vi. one which is out of health is defeated.

Ans-3 :
i. take the inputs from the user.
ii. check if the inputs are correct.
iii. generate a random value and do as per the rule.
iv. One of the fighters start the fight according to the generated random value and rule.
v. Run a while loop of time, till the health of any one of the fighter is 0.
  - When the time is equal to the time when the thanos is recovered then:
      =as now a stone has been taken from thanos, then
       - Genrate a random number using rand() and apply the condition givn in the question-3
       - Also check if the present health is grater then 61.5% of the total health
       - refer the code to view operations.
       - increase the reattack and recover time of thanos to 3 sec.
  - when the time is eual to the time when the bahubali is fully recovered then damage the health of thanos.
      =check conditions  according to the rules given in the question and then damage the health of figher.
vi. one which is out of health is defeated.
