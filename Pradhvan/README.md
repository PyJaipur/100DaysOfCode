# Pradhvan Bisht 

I am a Python geek! and a novice Djangonaut, I love playing around with web technologies and have an interest in backend development. You can read more about me at [pradhvanbisht.in](https://pradhvanbisht.in/).

My 100 DaysofCode journey is sub-divided into weeks(sprints) where each day I will record my progress with the minimum time an hour and update the estimated and at the end of the week will calculate the estimated work done with the total work done. For now, the estimated time is 7 hrs per week. 

I mainly plan to finish the exercises of [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.in/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/812656217X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) and for the gap which I spend on reading chapters to reach to those exercises I would be either working on the questions from  [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python: The Insiders' Guide](https://www.amazon.in/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546330150&sr=1-1&keywords=elements+of+programming+interviews+in+python) or submitting patches to my half cooked side projects which reside at [PyRandon](https://github.com/Pradhvan/PyRandom). 

## Day 1 - Day 7 

#### Topic to Cover in the first week sprint:- 

1. **Exercises 2.7** : P-2.33 - P-2.39 [ETA 4 Days]

2. **Arrays** [ETA 3 Days]


#### Bonus:-

* Get inital setup done using trees to calculate distance for Spell Checker with The Levenshtein Algorithm.
