# [Your Name]
This is a template for your 100 Days of Code log. **DO NOT MODIFY THIS**. Instead, create a new file called "MyName.md" and copy this template there. Edit this to remove all template content and replace with your own.

Write a brief description about yourself and what you do. Write about what you want to accomplish in these 100 days of code. Feel free to include links to your github repos!

## Day 0 - [Date]
Create subheadings like this for each day. Replace [Date] with the actual date.
### Project 0
You can use level 3 subheadings to share about multiple projects you worked on in a day. When writing about the project for the 1st time, try to include a line of description as  well.

**Today's progress** - Write a line or two about what you did today in regard to this project.

**Thoughts** - (optional) Write some thoughts about what you felt when working on the project.

**Link to work** - (optional) Add a link to your work (like a public github repo). Links in markdown are added like this - `[text to display](URL)`

## Day 1 - [Date]
Rinse and repeat :smiley:
