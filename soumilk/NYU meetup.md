-> Q. Sir, I am really in a dilemma that what should I do now, because the IT industry is developing drastically and its becoming nearly <br>
      impossible for me to match up with the market requirements. <br>
   A. No company expects you to be the master of new technology, they just want to check your basics and foundation. 
   ```
   ```
-> Q. Is it really necessary to learn new technologies like ML, Blockchain, IOT etc for a good placement?<br>
   A. Not at all, at your stage, only things that are expected from you is the basic core subjects of the computer science.
      company train their employees according to their project, yes it is good to have a piece of knowledge about the recent tech but<br>
      focus on your core subjects like DSA, Database, OS etc. 
      ```
      ```
-> Q. I am always confused between the various streams, sometimes I think I should go in development then I switch to CP then I <br>
      think I should invest time in ML then my college syllabus stuck my mind, have to maintain my percentage !!! <br>
   A. Its quite natural and there is no need to worry, all you have to do is to find your interest and you can do it when you work<br>
      in the various streams. Just find that one stream which matches your passion and give you happiness, after that Don't scatter<br>
      your energy and concentrate on that only thing. 
      ```
      ```
-> Q. what tech has the most developing market?<br>
   A. There is nothing like a particular section lead the market of IT, we need everyone from a data analyst to a programmer, from
      a hacker to an animation designer. Every stream has a lot of scopes, all you need to do is have a good grasp on that 
      subject. You can't be good in everything but just make a command of that one thing and that will be enough for you. Just keep 
      updating your knowledge bank.
         ```
     ```    
-> Q. What kind of project should I make? I don't want to make a unique project, common projects do not interest me that much.<br>
   A. It is not the matter that you are making or an already implemented project, the thing which matters is what you have<br>
      learned. Even if a project is common, what the matter of concern is can you built it! 
      ```
      ```
-> Q. Being in a Tier-3 college affect our placement in tech giants ? I mean like students from IITs or IISCrs get a priority?
   A. Now this barrier is fading out. Companies do not really care about your college, all they care about is your skill. This is the <br>
      reason why most of the companies are conducting online competitions.
