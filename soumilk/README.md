# Soumil Khandelwal
Start of the #100DaysOfCode is really a great start to 2k19.
* Pre- final year CSE 
* JECRC foundation
* Mostly use C++ for coding but sometimes use Python as well.

# Target for the upcomming 100 Days
  * Get a strong grip on DSA.
  * Be a 6 star Problem solver , 5 star batches in both C++, Python on hackerrank.
  * Learn OpenCL.
  * Practice SPOJ 250 famous problems.
  * Make a good python project.
  
### Day 1
  * Did planning for the upcomming 100 days.
  * Practised problem 'Queen Attack II' on hackerrank (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/queens-attack-2/problem)
    still trying that quesiton. Have used 2 approaches till now:<br>
        -> First one was having a huge space complexity.<br>
        -> Successed to overcome the space complexity issue and with this present approach , passed 14 out of 21 test cases.<br>
        -> Still making efforts to solve the problem.
        
### Day 2
  * Finially did the question Queen's attack II in both python and c++, although the logic is same.
  * You can checkout both the solutions in my repository (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/tree/master/implementation)
  * Leetcode Question solved -> 217.Contains Duplicate.
  * Leetcode Question solved -> 219.Contains Duplicate II.
  
### Day 3 
  * Arrived Jaipur from hometown.
  * Read about binary heaps from geeks for geeks.

### Day 4
  * Solved Hackerrank problem Funny String (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/funny-string/problem), you can check out my solution in (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/Strings/Funny%20String.cpp).
  * Solved Hackerrank problem Encryption (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/encryption/problem), solution at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/implementation/Encryption.cpp).

### Day 5
  * Read about sorting algorithums.( Selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort ).
  * Solved a question, "The time in words" (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-time-in-words/problem) and solution at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/implementation/The%20Time%20in%20Words.cpp).
  
### Day 8
  * Solved Hackerrank problems. <br>
    Game of Thrones-I (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-thrones/submissions/code/95140716) and solution is available at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/Strings/Game%20Of%20Thrones-I.cpp).<br>
    Non-Divisible Subset (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/non-divisible-subset/problem) and solution for this problem is at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/implementation/Non-Divisible%20subset.cpp).
    
### Day 9
   * Solved Leetcode Questions :<br>
     Two Sum : This question can be solved by simple approach but still, it took me some time to solve this one.<br>
     Reverse Integer : This was a easy problem, only thing to keep in mind is the boundations upon the range of the number.<br> 


### Day 10
   * Learned Deque from geeks for geeks. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications/) 
   * Learned about the fast exponentiation and fast modulo multiplication.
   
### Day 12 
   * Attended a meetup with the NYU (New York University) ambassadors, Both were Indian students from Tandon school of engineering pursuing MS 
   in computer science.<br>
   * Had a conversation with them about GRE and how to proceed for the studies abroad.
   * I have shared my experience and guidance which I got from them in file named ' NYU meetup.md' , I think they might be helpful.

### Day 13
   * Tried to solve Hackerrank question- The Bomberman Game (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bomber-man/problem).

### Day 14 
   * Solved question- The Bomberman Game in python, initially it seems a tricky question but then afterwards when you understand the patern of the problem, its a simple one. Check out the solution at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/implementation/The%20Bomberman%20Game.py)
