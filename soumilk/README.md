### Day 1
  * Did planning for the upcomming 100 days.
  * Practised problem 'Queen Attack II' on hackerrank (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/queens-attack-2/problem)
    still trying that quesiton. Have used 2 approaches till now:<br>
        -> First one was having a huge space complexity.<br>
        -> Successed to overcome the space complexity issue and with this present approach , passed 14 out of 21 test cases.<br>
        -> Still making efforts to solve the problem.
        
### Day 2
  * Finially did the question Queen's attack II in both python and c++, although the logic is same.
  * You can checkout both the solutions in my repository (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/tree/master/implementation)
  * Leetcode Question solved -> 217.Contains Duplicate.
  * Leetcode Question solved -> 219.Contains Duplicate II.
  
### Day 3
