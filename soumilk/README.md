# Soumil Khandelwal
Start of the #100DaysOfCode is really a great start to 2k19.
* Pre- final year CSE 
* JECRC foundation
* Mostly use C++ for coding but sometimes use Python as well.

# Target for the upcomming 100 Days
  * Get a strong grip on DSA.
  * Be a 6 star Problem solver , 5 star batches in both C++, Python on hackerrank.
  * Learn OpenCL.
  * Practice SPOJ 250 famous problems.
  * Make a good python project.
  
### Day 1
  * Did planning for the upcomming 100 days.
  * Practised problem 'Queen Attack II' on hackerrank (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/queens-attack-2/problem)
    still trying that quesiton. Have used 2 approaches till now:<br>
        -> First one was having a huge space complexity.<br>
        -> Successed to overcome the space complexity issue and with this present approach , passed 14 out of 21 test cases.<br>
        -> Still making efforts to solve the problem.
        
### Day 2
  * Finially did the question Queen's attack II in both python and c++, although the logic is same.
  * You can checkout both the solutions in my repository (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/tree/master/implementation)
  * Leetcode Question solved -> 217.Contains Duplicate.
  * Leetcode Question solved -> 219.Contains Duplicate II.
  
### Day 3 
  * Arrived Jaipur from hometown.
  * Read about binary heaps from geeks for geeks.

### Day 4
  * Solved Hackerrank problem Funny String (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/funny-string/problem), you can check out my solution in (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/Strings/Funny%20String.cpp).
  * Solved Hackerrank problem Encryption (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/encryption/problem), solution at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/implementation/Encryption.cpp).

### Day 5
  * Read about sorting algorithums.( Selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort ).
  * Solved a question, "The time in words" (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-time-in-words/problem) and solution at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/implementation/The%20Time%20in%20Words.cpp).
  
### Day 8
  * Solved Hackerrank problems. <br>
    Game of Thrones-I (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-thrones/submissions/code/95140716) and solution is available at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/Strings/Game%20Of%20Thrones-I.cpp).<br>
    Non-Divisible Subset (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/non-divisible-subset/problem) and solution for this problem is at (https://github.com/soumilk/HackerRank_Programs/blob/master/implementation/Non-Divisible%20subset.cpp).
    
### Day 9
   * Solved Leetcode Questions :<br>
     Two Sum : This question can be solved by simple approach but still, it took me some time to solve this one.<br>
     Reverse Integer : This was a easy problem, only thing to keep in mind is the boundations upon the range of the number.<br> 

### Day 10
   * Learned Deque from geeks for geeks. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications/) 
   * Learned about the fast exponentiation and fast modulo multiplication.
   
### Day 12 
   * Attended a meetup with the NYU (New York University) ambassadors, Both were Indian students from Tandon school of engineering            pursuing MS in computer science.<br>
   * Had a conversation with them about GRE and how to proceed for the studies abroad.
   * I think I should share my experience and guidance which I got from them, I think they might be helpful. <br>
      -> Q. Sir, I am really in a dilemma that what should I do now, because the IT industry is developing drastically and its becoming             nearly impossible for me to match up with the market requirements. <br>
         A. No company expects you to be the master of new technology, they just want to check your basics and foundation. 
         
      -> Q. Is it really necessary to learn new technologies like ML, Blockchain, IOT etc for a good placement?<br>
         A. Not at all, at your stage, only things that are expected from you is the basic core subjects of the computer science.
         company train their employees according to their project, yes it is good to have a piece of knowledge about the recent tech but          focus on your core subjects like DSA, Database, OS etc. 
         
      -> Q. I am always confused between the various streams, sometimes I think I should go in development then I switch to CP then I               think I should invest time in ML then my college syllabus stuck my mind, have to maintain my percentage !!! <br>
      -> A. Its quite natural and there is no need to worry, all you have to do is to find your interest and you can do it when you work             in the various streams. Just find that one stream which matches your passion and give you happiness, after that Don't                   scatter your energy and concentrate on that only thing. 
      
      -> Q. what tech has the most developing market?<br>
         A. There is nothing like a particular section lead the market of IT, we need everyone from a data analyst to a programmer, from         a hacker to an animation designer. Every stream has a lot of scopes, all you need to do is have a good grasp on that                     subject. You can't be good in everything but just make a command of that one thing and that will be enough for you.
