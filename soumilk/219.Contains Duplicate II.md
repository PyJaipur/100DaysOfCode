## To solve this question, we need to consider an c++ STL container called unordered_map < type1, type2> container_name 

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
      unordered_map<int,int>umap;                   // Step 1
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            if(umap[nums[i]])                      // Step 3
            {
                if(i+1-umap[nums[i]]<=k)           // Step 4
                    return true;
            }
            umap[nums[i]]=i+1;                     // Step 2
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
Now, here is the explaination for this code,<br>
    * Step 1: We created a new container which is basically a key and a value pair container.<br>
    * Step 2: After we entered in the loop, we initialised the pair with the value 'i+1', the reason behind setting it 'i' instead of 'i+1' is stated in the next step.<br>
    * Step 3: Now, whenever we come across a key value of vector 'nums' which is already present in the container, we make a check and now remember we set up the value of key to i+1, this is because for the very first element of the vector the value of 'i' is zero, now because of this the value of expression at Step 3- would be -> 'umap[nums[i]]=0', which is false and our 'IF' statement would never execute for the 0th element of the vector. Therefore we set it as 'i+1'.<br>
    * Step 4: As we added an extra value to 'i' so we will subtract 1 in the condition and check it for the validity of our condition with respect to k.
