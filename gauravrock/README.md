- Prepared My Introduction Here and Planning here.
- Started working with datacamp path to data science and machine learning & started solving chllenges.:+1:
## Day - -2 : Jan 2nd 2019
- completed the datacamp introduction to python for data science.(it was a great introduction in a very subtle and efficient way to get a glimpse of library like NUMPY and compare it with lists in python) [here certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/9e38d8d76524521571c801d81ce11a19707a896c)
- worked with linear regression algorithms and started to implement using jupyter notebook.
- learned the basic of web scraping using python.
## Day - -3 : Jan 3rd 2019
- worked with web crawler and scraping using python and packages like Http requests and BeautifulSoup to crawl the links and images and tried to make a youtube downloader(but failed suddenly due to strong regex of youtube but will try again!:sweat_smile:).
- also had a hands on some packages of python for ML and datascience such as Matplotlib , pandas etc from datacamp.
## Day - -4 : Jan 4th 2019
- worked with Matplotlib and pandas .These python packages are great when it comes to data visualization and Data munging in python).
## Day - -5: Jan 5th 2019
- Read the book Learn python3 the hard way by ZED A. SHAW(a wonderful book to learn the core of python with every great detail)
## Day - -6 : Jan 6th 2019
- completed the datacamp's intermediate to python for data science.(it was a great introduction in a very subtle and efficient way to get a glimpse of library like matplotlib and using hacker statistics to solve some data science problem) [here certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/84d76fa4bda94d6669c16b1e19a36539e1e56046)
## Day - -7 : Jan 7th 2019
-worked with python automation and establish it using Jupyter notebook.
## Day - -8 : Jan 8th 2019
#day8 It's almost 1 week in #100DaysOfCode  or #100DaysOfMLCode. Today, worked with understanding the basic Neural net & backpropagation techniques to derive more accuracy.
## Day - -9 : Jan 9th 2019
- #day9 was worth in learning the basic of functions and Understanding the LEGB functions rules and also, working with foliumüó∫Ô∏è package for maps---this package if great to demonstrate the data over the world map.
## Day - -10 : Jan 10th 2019
-completed the Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) and explored the core of functions in python including the lambda and various methods in functions like map and filter. Ultimately the goal was to work with the Dataset.

## Day - -11 : Jan 11th 2019
- #day11 Worked with open lane detectionüõ£Ô∏è using OpenCV, This is one of the computer vision problems to tackle in Self-driving carsüöó in the 21st century i.e., to develop more precise algorithms for detection.ü§ñüßê
## Day - -12 : Jan 12th 2019
- worked with coding problem on hackearth and other hackerrank
## Day - -13 : Jan 13th 2019
- worked with competitve programming on various portals and started working with pyjudge project.
## Day - -14 : Jan 14th 2019
- learn the basic of git and how to embed that to the project.
## Day - -15 : Jan 15th 2019
- learn the core basics of probability and statistics. Understanding the Frequent ist and Bayesian statistics is funüìèüìé and also understood the difference b/w relative frequency and probability when applied to sample and population of data. 
## Day - -16 : Jan 16th 2019
- #day16 understand the core concept of Descriptive statement and probability distribution. And, a difference between the continuous and discrete random variables. Probabilistic distribution has the power that can derive the formula for randomness
## Day - -17 : Jan 17th 2019
- #day17 worked with PMF functions using scipy library ad plotted the probability function. And learned to generate fake-data using descriptive statistics. 
## Day - -18 : Jan 18th 2019
- Learned the Gaussian distribution and why normal distribution is called the Gaussian distribution.
## Day - -19 : Jan 19th 2019
- Learned the basics of cumulative probability and how to calculate the Gaussian value using the Normal curve table. And, also understand the basics difference between standard normal distribution and normal distribution.
## Day - -20 : Jan 20th 2019
- worked with the Binominal & Normal distribution. Also, get an instance of how the these are mapping the world and how Z-score is used in Standard Normal probablity Distribution.

## Day - -21 : Jan 21th 2019
- worked with the Inferencial statistics and understand how vast effect inferencial from probability distribution has on the real world. This map the basics of Machine learning and data analysis.
## Day - -22 : Jan 22th 2019
- Generated the fake data using descriptive statistics and plotted that using Matplotlib and scipy. Also, worked with Dice-throw problem using Binomial distribution.
## Day - -23 : Jan 23th 2019
- Worked with MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION algorithm for finding the MUV estimator for the natural parameter of probability distribution. This is at the core of Inferential statistics.
## Day - -24 : Jan 24th 2019
- #Day24 Set up a project in a git and this is going to be the second open source contribution in a row.(more details-- s√≥√≥√±ü§ñ) Also worked with the inferential stats at its core.ü§ì 
## Day - -25 : Jan 25th 2019
- Learned the second and most important application of Inferential stats i.e., to determine whether the treatment of something has asignificant effect on population or not?? This has a great useful in data analysis as well as business analyst.
## Day - -26 : Jan 26th 2019
- worked with list & dictionary comprehension as well as generators to stream a large bunch of data. Gained datacamp [certificate] (https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/ccaf7ebb7b1406a63ea5dfe28b724365fb7ca347)
## Day - -27 : Jan 27th 2019
- worked with Type1 and Type2 category error. These two erroes defines the category of error in machine learning and various deep learning problems.
