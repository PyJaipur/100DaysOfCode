## Day - -1 : Jan 1st 2019
- Prepared My Introduction Here and Planning here.
- Started working with datacamp path to data science and machine learning & started solving chllenges.:+1:
## Day - -2 : Jan 2nd 2019
- completed the datacamp introduction to python for data science.(it was a great introduction in a very subtle and efficient way to get a glimpse of library like NUMPY and compare it with lists in python) [here certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/9e38d8d76524521571c801d81ce11a19707a896c)
- worked with linear regression algorithms and started to implement using jupyter notebook.
- learned the basic of web scraping using python.
## Day - -3 : Jan 3rd 2019
- worked with web crawler and scraping using python and packages like Http requests and BeautifulSoup to crawl the links and images and tried to make a youtube downloader(but failed suddenly due to strong regex of youtube but will try again!:sweat_smile:).
- also had a hands on some packages of python for ML and datascience such as Matplotlib , pandas etc from datacamp.
## Day - -4 : Jan 4th 2019
- worked with Matplotlib and pandas .These python packages are great when it comes to data visualization and Data munging in python).
