#Introduction

I'm Akshit Aggarwal, 19. I'm a Information Technology Freshman year student from New Delhi. The main reason for me just like most people is get into the continuity of Programming. I'm not yet sure what all I'll be doing each and every day but I'm looking forward to learning to lots of new things. Currently I'm doing a course of EdX named CS50x offered by Harvard University, it's a wonderful course, although it's introductory it can get very challenging at times, but if you bear through it you will learn a lot of thing as I'm right now. 

Other than CS50 I'm also doing problems at Project Euler, it's all about solving Mathematical problems using Programming algorithm, their website only takes input as a Mathematical number which is the answer to the problem that you're solving.
